# The Pit of Despair
## A 2D platformer where you fall in a pit, and have to progress through levels, fight enemies, and defeat bosses to make your way out. You were once a simple cube, drifting peacefully through a digital world… until the ground gave way. Now you’ve plummeted into The Pit of Despair, a molten labyrinth teeming with chaos. Lava pulses beneath your feet, shadows twist around jagged walls, and monstrous bosses rule each layer of this infernal prison. Your only goal: escape. Navigate treacherous terrain, dodge deadly traps, and battle corrupted cube-beasts and mechanical horrors. Each level is a test of reflexes, strategy, and sheer willpower. As you ascend, the challenges grow fiercer—and the secrets of the Pit begin to unravel.

Will you rise from the fire, or be consumed by it?
