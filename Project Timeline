1. Game Design

Define player mechanics: movement, jumping, combat.

Design 3–5 levels (each a “layer” of the pit).

Map out difficulty progression and boss fights.

2. Coding

Player controller (movement, jump, health).

Enemy AI (patrol, attack).

Level transitions.

UI (health bar, menu, restart).

Game manager (restart, win/lose logic).

3. Art & Animation

Design player cube (basic and “corrupted” forms).

Create environment tiles: lava, rock, metal.

Design enemies (cube beasts, bosses).

Particle effects: fire, sparks, damage.

4. Audio

Ambient lava sounds.

Jump, hit, and death effects.

Background music for each layer.

5. Testing & QA

Playtest levels for difficulty and bugs.

Collect feedback and fix major issues.

6. Documentation & Presentation

Game design document (GDD).

Presentation slides or demo video.
