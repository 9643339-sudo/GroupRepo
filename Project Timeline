1. Game Design
* Define player mechanics: movement, jumping, combat.
* Design 3–5 levels (each a “layer” of the pit).
* Map out difficulty progression and boss fights.

2. Coding
* Player controller (movement, jump, health).
* Enemy AI (patrol, attack).
* Level transitions.
* UI (health bar, menu, restart).
* Game manager (restart, win/lose logic).

3. Art & Animation
* Design player cube (basic and “corrupted” forms).
* Create environment tiles: lava, rock, metal.
* Design enemies (cube beasts, bosses).
* Particle effects: fire, sparks, damage.

4. Audio
* Ambient lava sounds.
* Jump, hit, and death effects.
* Background music for each layer.

5. Testing & QA
* Playtest levels for difficulty and bugs.
* Collect feedback and fix major issues.

6. Documentation & Presentation
* Game design document (GDD).
* Presentation slides or demo video.
